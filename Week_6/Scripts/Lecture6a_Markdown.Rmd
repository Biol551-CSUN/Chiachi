# Introduction 
Today we are going to work with the penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*.

## Load Libraries 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
library(ymlthis)
```

# Inspect the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
This is a plot of penguins, looking at bill length by bill depth. **Species** are in colors.
Species are:  
  - Gentoo  
  - Adelie  
  - Chinstrap  
```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+ # here is a linear model
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", 
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")+
  theme_bw()
```
